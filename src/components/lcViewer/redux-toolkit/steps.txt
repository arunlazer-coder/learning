1.create a Store using configureStore 

        const store = configureStore({
        reducer: {
            redux: reduxReducer //define the reducer which is u are going to use
        },
        })
        
2.create a Slice using createSlice which will basically contain everything state , actions . 
need to export 3 things 
    1.counterSlice ( The Slice which we are creating )
    1.actions ( The Actions comes under the Slice )
    1.reducers ( which is gonna pass into store )

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState:{value:0},
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

export default counterSlice.reducer

3.use useSelector hook for data fetch , useDispatch Hook for actions ( updating state)
  
  const data = useSelector(state => state.redux); //after state we need check for name of slice
